# Beggining with small projects...
## Quickstarting a few programming languages.

Starting to know different programming languages with [BugginhoDeveloper on GitHub](https://github.com/BugginhoDeveloper). This idea was taken from [Bugginho's Facebook post](https://pt-br.facebook.com/BugginhoDeveloper/posts/632947270208345). It's to leave our "comfort zone" by developing small projects in different programming languages, despite any [prejudice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice), gaining nothing but experience.
